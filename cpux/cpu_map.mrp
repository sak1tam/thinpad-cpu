  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,103 out of  17,344    6%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            592 out of   8,672    6%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     592 out of     592 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     592   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,118 out of  17,344    6%

    Number used as a route-thru:         15

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Map:120 - The command line option -c can not be used when running in
   timing mode.  The option will be ignored.
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:Pack:2609 - SmartGuide is more efficient (better guiding and runtime)
   when used with explicit timing constraints. If you want the full benefit of
   the SmartGuide flow, please add timing constraints to your design, then
   re-create your guide file.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Map:192 - SmartGuide automatically enables -timing. If SmartGuide is
   disabled, -timing should be enabled if the resulting design will be used as a
   guide file during a later run.
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s1200e' is a WebPack part.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:980 - The following NGM file is used during SmartGuide:
   "E:\Learn\cpux\cpu_map.ngm". The NGM file contains information on how the
   guide file was originally mapped. It is required for the best SmartGuide
   results.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1711 - The design is currently running in timing mode. However, the
   guide file "E:/Learn/cpux/cpu_guide.ncd" was not created using map "-timing".
   For best results, you may want to guide from a "-timing" guide file.
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   2 block(s) optimized away

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.

  Estimated SmartGuide Results
  ----------------------------
  This section describes the guide results after placement. Re-implemented 
  components are components that were guided, but moved in order to satisfy
  timing requirements.

    Estimated Percentage of guided Components                 | 100.0%
    Estimated Percentage of re-implemented Components         |   0.0%
    Estimated Percentage of new/changed Components            |   0.0%
    Estimated Percentage of fully guided Nets                 | 100.0%
    Estimated Percentage of partially guided or unrouted Nets |   0.0%

  A detailed SmartGuide report (.GRF) can be generated during PAR by
  specifying the [-smartguide <guidefile[.ncd]>] switch on the PAR
  command line. The GRF file contains all components and nets that were
  not guided. A final summary report is always generated and is available
  in the PAR report file and in the GRF regardless of the PAR -smartguide switch.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
