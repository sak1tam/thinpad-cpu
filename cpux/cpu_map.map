WARNING:Pack:2609 - SmartGuide is more efficient (better guiding and runtime)
   when used with explicit timing constraints. If you want the full benefit of
   the SmartGuide flow, please add timing constraints to your design, then
   re-create your guide file.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           296 out of  17,344    1%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,103 out of  17,344    6%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            592 out of   8,672    6%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     592 out of     592 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     592   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,118 out of  17,344    6%
    Number used as logic:             1,103
    Number used as a route-thru:         15

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 55 out of     250   22%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.89

Peak Memory Usage:  395 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  14 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   13 secs
