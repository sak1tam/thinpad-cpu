<msg type="info" file="Map" num="192" delta="new" >SmartGuide automatically enables -timing. If SmartGuide is disabled, -timing should be enabled if the resulting design will be used as a guide file during a later run.

<msg type="warning" file="Map" num="120" delta="new" >The command line option -c can not be used when running in timing mode.  The option will be ignored.

<msg type="info" file="MapLib" num="980" delta="new" >The following NGM file is used during SmartGuide: &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">E:\Learn\cpux\cpu_map.ngm</arg>&quot;. The NGM file contains information on how the guide file was originally mapped. It is required for the best SmartGuide results.

<msg type="info" file="LIT" num="244" delta="old" >All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

<msg type="info" file="Pack" num="1711" delta="new" >The design is currently running in timing mode. However, the guide file &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">E:/Learn/cpux/cpu_guide.ncd</arg>&quot; was not created using map &quot;-timing&quot;. For best results, you may want to guide from a &quot;-timing&quot; guide file.

<msg type="warning" file="Pack" num="2609" delta="new" >SmartGuide is more efficient (better guiding and runtime) when used with explicit timing constraints. If you want the full benefit of the SmartGuide flow, please add timing constraints to your design, then re-create your guide file.

<msg type="info" file="Pack" num="1650" delta="new" >Map created a placed design.
